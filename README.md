## Samples Repository
Welcome to the samples repository.  Each of the major coding samples from this semester has been broken down into a separate file.  Please examine each of the js files for examples of how to build the structures we have studied in the second half of the semester.

## Make A Tip Sheet
In the JavaScript files listed below are examples of the structures studied over the second half of the 3200 course.  For the upcoming bonus test, read through each of the files.  Create a handwritten tip sheet showing simple examples of what you see.  You can use 1-2 sheets of 8.5x11 paper for your tip sheet.

Please note that your tip sheet should not be a printout or photo of what you see here.  Take the time to summarize the contents so you may better remember them during the test.  Practice and recall are critical.

## How will I use the Tip Sheet
Once you create your tip sheet, submit it through DC Connect. Each tip sheet is unique to the student.  Please do not share tip sheets.  It is important to make your own.  Your tip sheet will be graded on it's coverage of the materials listed in the files from this repo, and ease of use.

If your tip sheet is approved, please bring it to the bonus test.  Refer to it during the test to assist you in answering questions.

## Bonus Test
The optional bonus test is worth up to 10% towards your final grade.  If you take the optional bonus test, you will be eligible for up to a 20% addition to your final grade.  Up to 10% for your Tip Sheet, and up to 10% for your test.  The tip sheet only counts for grading if the optional bonus test is taken.

The test will be composed of 5 sections.  Each section gives a choice of two questions.  Pick 1 question from each section to answer.  The sections are:

- Variables
- Functions
- Classes
- DOM Manipulation
- Scope Binding


## Contents
### arraysObjects.js
This file contains samples of the structure of arrays and objects.  It also covers array methods to make searching for data a breeze.

### classes.js
ES6 classes add convenience to javascript.  Check out how to make a class, create an instance, and pass in variables.

### data.json
A simple sample of a json file.

### domManipulation.js
You can use JavaScript to edit HTML and CSS on the fly.

### fetch.js
Fetch provides es6 with the ability to use JavaScript promises to grab data and call other servers for information.  Check out the structure of a basic fetch command here.

### functions.js
Functions bundle sections of code for later re-use.  They can be passed data, manipulate data, and return data to the world.  They come in various flavours from declaration to fat arrow.

### index.html
This is a basic html page.  It contains links to each of the javascript files.  Run your lite server to see the code in action.  Be sure to open your console log.

### intervals.js
Intervals let actions repeat at a set period of time.

### scope.js
Scope is where a value lives  It can be global or local.  In this file we manipulate the scope of a function with the use of call, apply, and bind.

### variables.js
Variables in es6 are defined with either let or const.  They can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and even functions. We can use template literals to combine data and variables together.
